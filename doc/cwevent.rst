cwevent: Expanded event descriptor
==================================

:program:`cwevent` is a command-line tool which extracts detailed
information about individual events (plays) in the data file. These
are grouped into two categories. There are 97 fields which are
compatible with the Retrosheet BEVENT event descriptor tool.  These
are specified using the ``-f`` command-line flag. In addition, cwevent
offers a number "extended" fields which expand upon or give more
detailed information not easily accessed via the standard
fields. These are are specified using the ``-x`` command-line flag.

.. note::

   :program:`cwevent` guarantees that the standard field numbers will
   match those used by BEVENT.  Standard field numbers therefore can
   be treated as stable, and it should be safe to write scripts
   referring to them.  Extended fields are provisional, and extended
   fields may be added or withdrawn in future versions.  Extended
   fields are assigned numbers to maintain a logical cohesion, with
   related fields being grouped.  Therefore, extended field numbers
   are not promised to be stable.  It is recommended to use the field
   labels instead in writing scripts to process the output of
   :program:`cwevent` extended fields.

.. _cwtools.cwevent.resplayers:

Result batters and pitchers (fields 10-17)
------------------------------------------

In most cases, the pitcher and batter charged or credited with
the event (when a batter event) are the ones in the game when the
event occurs. However, Rules 10.17 and 10.18 have special clauses
discussing how to charge walks to pitchers when a relief pitcher
enters in the middle of the plate appearance, and how to charge
strikeouts to batters when a pinch hitter enters in the middle of the
plate appearance. The batter and
pitcher fields always give the identity of the
batter and pitcher in the game at the time of the event; the
result batter and result pitcher
give the batter and pitcher credited or charged with the event.

There is one known bug in the Retrosheet-provided tools
regarding the result pitcher. When a relief pitcher enters the game,
and then the next batter is retired on a fielder's choice, the pitcher
responsible for the runner put out is shown in the result
pitcher field. While it is correct that the batter reaching
base in this case would be charged to the former pitcher should he
score, the purpose of the result pitcher field is
to indicate the pitcher charged with the outcome of this particular
event. In this case, for example, the relief pitcher is awarded
one-third of an inning pitched; therefore, he should be the
result pitcher, and then the previous pitcher
should be (and is) listed in the responsible
pitcher field for the batter in subsequent events.

In the case of switch-hitters, the batter
hand and result batter hand fields are
set to L or R, as appropriate,
based upon the hand with which the pitcher throws. If the pitcher's
throwing hand is unknown, or if the batter's batting hand is unknown,
a question mark appears in these fields.

.. _cwtools.cwevent.phflag:

Pinch-hit flag (field 31)
-------------------------

This field is T if the batter is a
pinch-hitter, and F if he is not. If a
player enters the game as a pinch-hitter, and then bats again in the
same inning because his team bats around, this field will be
F for the player's second plate appearance. To
identify the cases where this occurs, consult the defensive
position field (field 32), which will continue to be equal
to 11 (or 12 for a pinch-runner) until that player assumes a defensive
position.

Sacrifice flags and eras (fields 36, 38, 39)
--------------------------------------------

Chadwick in all cases applies the modern rules concerning the
awarding of sacrifice hits, sacrifice flies, and official times at
bat, regardless of the year indicated with the -y flag.

.. _cwtools.cwevent.plays:

Plays on runners (fields 58-65)
-------------------------------

Fields 58 through 65 give the destination of all runners,
including the batter, as well as the fielding play made on them, if
any. For the purposes of the destination fields, a code of 5 indicates
the runner scored, and is charged as unearned, and a code of 6
indicates the runner scored, and is charged as unearned to the team,
but earned to the pitcher. These codes only appear when the
(NR) or (TUR) modifiers are
explicitly used on the advancement code. There is no internal logic in
Chadwick to ferret out which runs should be earned or unearned, as in
many cases there is insufficient information, or the situation
requires the judgment of the official scorer. Runners which are put
out are reported as having an advancement of 0.

In most cases, the play on a runner indicates the fielding
credits involved in putting him out. Chadwick also reports a fielding
play on a runner when the runner is safe on a dropped throw, such as
3E1 or FC6.1X2(6E4).

Fielding errors (fields 51-57)
------------------------------

Up to three errors can be indicated in
:program:`cwevent` output. Supported error types are
F for generic fielding errors, and
T for throwing errors; no distinction is made
between bobbled batted balls, muffed throws or fly balls, and so
forth.

.. _cwtools.cwevent.responsibility:

Pitcher responsibility for runs (fields 75-77)
----------------------------------------------

The Official Rules for charging runs to pitchers stipulate that if a
pitcher is relieved in the middle of an inning with runners left on
base, he is charged with runs if those runners (or the ones who
replace them in the event of fielder's choices) subsequently score in
the inning.  The current rule is Rule 10.16(g), the comment on which
in the rules states:

   It is the intent of Rule 10.16(g) to charge each pitcher with the
   number of runners he put on base, rather than with the individual
   runners. When a pitcher puts runners on base and is relieved, such
   pitcher  shall be charged with all runs subsequently scored up to
   and including the number of runners such pitcher left on base when
   such pitcher left the game, unless such runners are put 
   out without action by the batter.

Chadwick implements this by assigning "responsibility"
for runners, and shifting those runners after fielder's choices as
appropriate to implement the rule.  Fields 75 through 77 report the
pitcher currently "charged" with runners on base using this method.

There is one special case to note in reporting these fields.  As
noted, a fielder's choice does not absolve a departed pitcher for
responsibility for a potential run. Ordinarily it is good enough to
report the shift in responsibility at the start of the next play.
However, consider the following scenario: The bases are loaded, with
the runner on third (R3) the responsibility of Pitcher A and runners
on second and first (R2 and R1) the responsibility of Pitcher B. The
batter hits a ground ball and R3 is forced at home. Then, the catcher
throws wildly trying to complete the double play, and as a result R2
scores.  In this case, the run scored by R2 is charged to Pitcher A,
not Pitcher B, i.e., the responsibility shifts in the middle of the
play. In order to facilitate calculation of runs and earned runs
allowed correctly from cwevent output, in this case, the record for
the play will report R2 as being the responsibility of Pitcher A,
i.e., it will report the responsibility after the mid-play shift. 

This convention will not affect most applications.  Indeed, the
Official Rules technically do not have a concept of assigning
responsibility to particular runners, and the contents of fields 75-77
only have meaning on plays in which the corresponding runners
score. This convention may confuse certain calculations, however,
including those which try to track what happens to inherited runners,
if one does not take appropriate care to handle this very unusual case.

Fielding credits (fields 88-95)
-------------------------------

The order in which Chadwick and the Retrosheet-provided tools
list putouts and assists may vary. The number of plays on which this
occurs is quite few, and generally in cases where there is a putout
in the primary event as well as one in the baserunning modifiers.
The words "first", "second" and so on do not necessarily indicate
chronological order of the credits, though in most cases they
do.
